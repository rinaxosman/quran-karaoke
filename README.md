A small web app to help you practice Qur’an recitation ayah by ayah.

## Current Features

- **Reciter selection**  
  Choose from multiple reciters; audio updates automatically.

- **Two modes**
  - **Learning Mode** – Plays the full surah and highlights each ayah as it’s recited.
  - **Practice Mode** – Plays one ayah at a time so you can repeat after the reciter.

- **Ayah-by-ayah playback**
  - Click any ayah to start playing from there.
  - The currently playing ayah is clearly highlighted.
  - Smooth auto-scroll keeps the active ayah in view.

- **Surah picker**
  - Quick “Click to choose a surah” dropdown so you don’t have to press “Next” a million times.

  - Simple layout focused on readability of Arabic, transliteration, and translation.

## Roadmap / Upcoming Features

  Show brief tafsīr / explanations for each ayah.

  Expand beyond the current set to support more (eventually all) surahs.
